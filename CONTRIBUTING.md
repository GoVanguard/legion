We ask that you also follow our contributor [**Code of Conduct**](#code-of-conduct). We look forward to working with you - get started in one of the sections below.



#### Do you have a general question?

* Ask your question [ place to ask questions ]



#### Did you find a bug?

* Awesome. First, ensure that your bug isn't a duplicate by checking the [Issues](https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion/issues). **If the issue already exists**, go ahead and comment on the issue with your bug report information, following the guidelines below as if you were reporting a new issue - just don't make a new issue.

#### Did you patch a bug?

* Excellent - your first steps are to open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion/pulls) with your patch. Be prepared to answer questions or receive feedback from the team.
* Ensure the PR has a description that clearly details the problem and your solution. Be sure to include issue numbers if possible.
* Follow our coding practices and standards for whatever files you're working on.



#### Do you want to add a feature?

* We love new features! Please [make an issue](https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion/issues/new) for discussion, with a clear title and description of the proposed feature. Add the Proposal tag, and use the comments to follow up with the team.
* We suggest you wait for feedback on your feature proposal before working on a patch and submitting a PR.



#### Code of Conduct

We like to keep the rules simple. 

* Behavior meant to malign, disrespect, denigrate, harass, or attack any person will not be tolerated.
* Use respectful language and foster a community of collaboration.
